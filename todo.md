### Have to update the "Run last active test more powerful"
    - The option name will be changed to "Latest test" from "Run Last Active Test". if users choose "Latest test" test then they will see the following options:  "Run Latest test", "Change variation" (here user will be able to change the variation under the same test, user will see a variation list and after choosing variation the test will imidiately run), "change test" (here user will be able to change the test under same website, they will see the test list, after choosing test they will see the variation list and after choosing variation the test will start automatically). "Change variation" and "change test" will be shown if the last run test is ran only a single test, this two feature wont be applicable if last running test is a list of test. if last run test is a a group of tests then user will see the only one option "Run Last Active Tests" when they choose "Latest test".
